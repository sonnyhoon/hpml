# Project Title: Optimization of RoBERTa Model for Efficient Inference

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a RoBERTa model using various techniques such as quantization, pruning, mixed precision, and efficient data loading. The goal is to enhance the model's inference performance while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- `quantization.py`: Applies dynamic quantization to the model and measures the performance impact.
- `pruning.py`: Implements pruning on the model's parameters to reduce complexity and improve inference speed.
- `mixed_precision_inference.py`: Utilizes mixed precision to accelerate inference.
- `efficient_data_loading.py`: Optimizes the data loading process to reduce the time it takes to feed data into the model for inference.
- `integrated_optimization.py`: Combines all the optimizations to measure the collective impact on the model's performance.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and additional documentation.
- `results/`: Folder containing PDFs of the performance results and visualizations.
