# Project Title: Optimization of RoBERTa Model for Efficient Inference

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing a RoBERTa model using various techniques such as quantization, pruning, mixed precision, and efficient data loading. The goal is to enhance the model's inference performance while maintaining or even improving accuracy.

## Repository Structure
- `quantization.py`: Applies dynamic quantization to the model and measures the performance impact.
- `pruning.py`: Implements pruning on the model's parameters to reduce complexity and improve inference speed.
- `mixed_precision_inference.py`: Utilizes mixed precision to accelerate inference.
- `efficient_data_loading.py`: Optimizes the data loading process to reduce the time it takes to feed data into the model for inference.
- `integrated_optimization.py`: Combines all the optimizations to measure the collective impact on the model's performance.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and additional documentation.
- PDFs of the performance results and visualizations.

  - `pruning_performance.pdf`
  - `mixed_precision_performance.pdf`
  - `data_loading_efficiency.pdf`

## Setup and Installation
To run the scripts in this repository, you will need Python 3.8 or later, along with the following packages:
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Matplotlib
- Pandas



Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install torch transformers matplotlib pandas
```

## Running the Scripts
Each script can be run independently to test specific optimizations. Here are the commands to run each script from the terminal:
### Quantization
```bash
python quantization.py
```
This script will quantize the model and measure the inference performance before and after quantization.

### Pruning
```bash
python pruning.py
```
Executes pruning on the model, saves the pruned model, and evaluates its performance.

### Mixed Precision Inference
```bash
python mixed_precision_inference.py
```
Tests the inference performance using mixed precision settings.


### Efficient Data Loading

```bash
python efficient_data_loading.py
```
Analyzes how different data loader configurations affect model inference time.

### Integrated Optimization

```bash
python integrated_optimization.py
```
Combines all optimizations and measures their collective impact on performance.


## Results
The results of each optimization are saved as PDF files. Each PDF contains graphs and charts that illustrate the performance improvements or any trade-offs encountered during testing.
Refer to the PDFs in the results/ directory for detailed visualizations and analysis of each optimization strategy.
